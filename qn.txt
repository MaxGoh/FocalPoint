Okay, my curent goal is to add additional field in the defualt django auth User model, and also to instantly add the field in the Registration Form, So for now, simply a DOB field. So currently I have managed to add that field by creating a onetoonemodel UserProfile class, and then linking it up in the admins.py. I know that I should use signals [Post_Save] to be able to accomplish what I'm trying to do, but I'm stuck on this part, the docs aren't really that helpful for a beginner like me. This is my current code https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4c47ff62df6d1158a5db25fcd2e5debc
